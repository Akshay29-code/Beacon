This application now includes **automated database setup** that will configure your Appwrite database with all the necessary collections, attributes, permissions, and indexes.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Start your application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/setup`
3. Click "Run Database Setup"
4. Wait for the setup to complete

2. Wait for the setup to complete
3. Start your application: `npm run dev`

## 📋 What Gets Created

The automated setup creates:

### Database Structure
- **Database**: `notes_database`
- **Collection**: `notes`
- **Attributes**: 9 required fields
- **Indexes**: 3 performance indexes

### Attributes Created
- `title` (String, 255 chars) - Note title

- **Secure authentication** - Integrated with Appwrite auth

## 🔧 Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up the database manually, follow the instructions in `DATABASE_SETUP.md`.

## ✅ Verification

After running the setup, you can verify everything is working by:

1. **Web Interface**: Click "Verify Setup" on the setup page
2. **Command Line**: The script automatically verifies the setup
3. **Manual Check**: Create a test note in the application

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied**
- Make sure you're logged into your Appwrite account
- Check that your project ID is correct in `app/appwrite.js`

**Database Already Exists**
- The setup will skip existing components
- This is normal and expected

**Network Errors**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your Appwrite project is accessible

### Getting Help

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Appwrite project configuration
3. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
4. Check the Appwrite console for any errors

## 🎉 Next Steps

After successful setup:

1. **Start the application**: `npm run dev`
2. **Create a user account** at `/auth/login`
3. **Start creating notes** at `/beacon`
4. **Enjoy your fully functional note-taking app!**
